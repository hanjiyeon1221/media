The story is inspired by the 1756 French fairy tale Beauty and the Beast by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont as well as the 1991 Disney animated film.</p>
                <p>Belle premiered on July 15, 2021, at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it was well-received by critics with a standing ovation that lasted fourteen minutes. The film was additionally dubbed into foreign languages (English, Portuguese Spanish, Italian, French and German). It was released theatrically in Japan on July 16, 2021. GKIDS has licensed the film in North America, with a nationwide release date of January 14, 2022, and previews in select IMAX theaters on January 12, while Anime Limited released the film in the United Kingdom on February 4, 2022.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Teenager Suzu Naito lives in the rural Kōchi Prefecture of Japan with a lost passion for singing and writing songs. When Suzu was young, she witnessed her mother rescue a child from a flooding river at the cost of her own life, causing her to resent her mother for "abandoning" her for a stranger's child and eventually grow distant from her father.</p>
                <p>Urged by Hiro, Suzu signs into the popular virtual metaverse "U" and is appointed a beautiful avatar with freckles (through the AI engine's biometric analysis) whom she names "Bell", the English translation of her own name. Upon logging into U, she finds herself capable of singing again. With the assistance of Hiro, who has appointed herself Bell's manager and producer, Bell almost immediately becomes a best-seller on U's music charts, and people start to refer to her as "Belle", meaning "beautiful" in French.</p>
